Echoing the decor, the cuisine served here plays with a combination of the traditional and the modern. The chef adds his own creative touches and interpretations to traditional recipes on three tasting menus: “Fattorie e Poderi” (meat), “Laghi e Mari” (fish), and the vegetarian “Campi e Orti”. Dishes can also be chosen à la carte style. The interesting wine list features more than 1 500 labels, including some rare options.   \n",

       "3  Giancarlo Perbellini returns to his origins in this historic restaurant in his native city, where every chef from Verona (and possibly beyond) would like to work. The updated decor gives the restaurant even more appeal, as does the culinary style and philosophy showcased on three tasting menus: “Io e Silva”, which includes decidedly imaginative dishes (such as cooked and raw shellfish with a dash of soya and peppers) and is dedicated to his wife; “Io e Giorgio”, dedicated to his mentor and former restaurant owner, which features more classic recipes; and, last but not least, the completely vegetarian “L'Essenza”. Special mention must be made of the wine list, which includes an extensive selection of French labels, of which both the sommelier and Giancarlo are huge fans. As a final attraction, make sure you find time to visit the Roman ruins in the basement. We also highly recommend booking the chef's table where you can dine as a couple yet at the same time enjoy the company of the skilled chefs whom you’ll observe working together like the well-practised members of an orchestra – an extraordinary sight!   \n",

The atmosphere is simple, informal and attractive, while the cuisine focuses on Roman classics such as pasta with carbonara, cacio e pepe, amatriciana and gricia sauces, alongside a few more creative dishes.   \n",
